# plant_seeds_classification
Image classification using CNNs in Keras
Project Description
Image classification using CNNs in KerasData Description:You are provided with a dataset  of  images of  plant seedlings at various stages of  growth.
Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The  dataset  comprises  12  plant  species.
The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining  a plant's species from a photo
Dataset:The dataset can be download from Olympus.The data file names are
images.npy
Label.csv
The original files are from Kaggle.
Due to the large volume of data, the images were converted to images.npy file and the labels are  also  put  into  the  Labels.csv.
